Here is the code for developing a missingness report for eMERGE 4 sites based on the meetings of the QA/QC Taskforce.

Intended use is to run the R script included in this repository followed by compiling the LaTeX document. The R script pulls report data from RedCap, generates summaries of missingness rates and their association to self report race, and outputs .tex files. The .tex file provided here uses the .tex files generated by the R script to output a report.
