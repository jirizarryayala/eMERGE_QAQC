Here is the code developed by to UW site to create a missingness report based on the meetings of the QA/QC Taskforce.

Intended use is to run the R script included in this repository followed by compiling the LaTeX document. The R script pulls report data from RedCap, generates summaries of missingness rates and their association to self-report race, and outputs two .tex files. The .tex file provided in this repository uses the .tex files generated by the R script to output a report in .pdf format.
